# OctoCAT Supply Chain Management Application

## Architecture

The complete architecture is described in the [Architecture Document](../docs/architecture.md).

# Build and Run Instructions

Refer to [build instructions](../docs/build.md) for detailed build instructions.

Every time you change the code, make sure that the code compiles by running:

```bash
npm run build
```

To run the unit tests for the API, run:

```bash
npm run test:api
```

## Agent Mode

When in agent mode create a new branch when implementing a new feature. 
Make sure to switch to the new branch before making any changes. 
Name that branch something descriptive, like `feature/your-feature-name`. 
The feature name should be concise and describe what is being implemented.
